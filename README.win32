       Building and running the PS Move API on a legacy operating system
       =================================================================

We usually build PS Move API for Windows on Linux via cross-compliation, as
we don't run Windows for day-to-day work. For cross-compiling the PS Move API
for Windows on Linux, you can use the following script:

	contrib/cross-compile-mingw64


Please take into account that Bluetooth pairing on Windows still does not work
as smoothly as on both Mac OS X and Linux. If you plan to do serious
development, it's time to switch to Mac OS X or Linux. As an alternative, you
can use a Linux host for Bluetooth communcation, and export the controller via
"moved" to the Windows host. This setup has reliable pairing, and you can still
develop and build your applications in Windows if you have to.


Requirements
------------

- MinGW
  http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php (Choose downloads, then Mingw-builds. See below for install instructions.)
- CMake
  http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
- Git
  http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/

Optional dependencies:

- CL Eye Driver (if you plan to use the PS Eye camera with 32-bit non-free drivers)
  http://codelaboratories.com/get/cl-eye-driver/
- CLEyeSDK (alternative 32-bit non-free drivers for PS Eye)
  http://codelaboratories.com/get/cl-eye-sdk/

IMPORTANT: Get the right MinGW version!

 -> "Regular" MinGW might not be able to build the PS Move API, as we are
    using some features that are only included in MinGW-w64.

 -> Get "MinGW-w64" instead. Despite its name, it also works for 32-bit
    systems (and you probably have to/want to build PS Move API as 32-bit
    library on Windows, anyway. This is also what we use, both for cross-
    compiling it on Linux, and for building it directly on Windows.

 -> The build has been successfully tested on Windows XP, Windows 7,
    and Windows 8 using MinGW-w64 version 4.9.1. To get it, you can either
    A) use the online installer or B) download the archive directly for
    manual setup:

    A) Get the online installer at http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/

       Run the installer using these setup settings:

           Version:        5.1.0
           Architecture:   i686 or x86_64
           Threads:        posix
           Exception:      sjlj or seh
           Build revision: 1
           
           Shorten the folder from default to something like C:\MinGW

    B) For 64-bit Windows, get the archive at
       http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/4.9.1/threads-posix/sjlj/

       For 32-bit Windows, get the archive at
       http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/4.9.1/threads-posix/sjlj/

       Extract the archive (using 7-Zip) and add the path to its "bin" subdirectory to the
       PATH environment variable like so, for instance:

           set PATH=C:\mingw32\bin;%PATH%


    NOTE: If you want to use the CL Eye Driver (for PS Eye camera) you *must*
          build everything as 32-bit binaries. The driver is, as of writing,
          only available in a 32-bit version that will not work together with
          64-bit builds of OpenCV and the PS Move API. The easiest way to
          achieve this is to install the i686 version of MinGW-w64 (see above)
          for the following build steps.

0. Run a MinGW terminal (e.g. C:\MinGW\mingw-w64.bat) and change to the parent folder where you will build psmoveapi.

1. Clone the PS Move API repository

	git clone --recursive git://github.com/thp/psmoveapi.git
	cd psmoveapi

2. Build and install OpenCV (Optional, only required if building positional tracker)

2a. Clone the OpenCV repository

	cd external
	git clone git://github.com/Itseez/opencv.git
	cd opencv

2b. Patch around a mingw-specific bug in OpenCV3 (see http://code.opencv.org/issues/4107)
	git apply ../../contrib/opencv.patch

2c. Configure the OpenCV build to produce static libs

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DBUILD_DOCS=0 -DBUILD_FAT_JAVA_LIB=0 -DBUILD_PACKAGE=0 -DBUILD_PERF_TESTS=0 -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=0 -DBUILD_TESTS=0 -DBUILD_opencv_apps=0 -DBUILD_opencv_calib3d=0 -DBUILD_opencv_features2d=0 -DBUILD_opencv_flann=0 -DBUILD_opencv_objdetect=0 -DBUILD_opencv_photo=0 -DBUILD_opencv_python2=0 -DBUILD_opencv_shape=0 -DBUILD_opencv_stitching=0 -DBUILD_opencv_superres=0 -DBUILD_opencv_ts=0 -DBUILD_opencv_video=0 -DBUILD_opencv_videostab=0 -DBUILD_opencv_world=0 -DWITH_FFMPEG=0 -DWITH_IPP=OFF -DWITH_JASPER=0 -DWITH_OPENEXR=0 -DWITH_TIFF=0

2d. Build and install OpenCV

	It will install to psmoveapi's opencv/build/install subdirectory.

	mingw32-make
	mingw32-make install

3. Configure the PS Move API build

	Switch back to the psmoveapi root directory.

	cd ..\..\..

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"

	Alternatively, if you want to use the CL Eye SDK:

	cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DPSMOVE_USE_CL_EYE_SDK=1

	Also alternatively, if you want to use the PS3EYEDriver:
	cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DPSMOVE_USE_PS3EYE_DRIVER=1 -DPSMOVE_USE_LOCAL_LIBUSB=1

4. Finally build the PS Move API

	mingw32-make

5. Pair the controller to the host

	Using the controllers' Bluetooth capabilities requires you to pair the
	controller to the host computer first. That is what the psmovepair utility
	is for. It is automatically built as part of the PS Move API.

	Make sure that Bluetooth is enabled on your computer, then connect a Move
	controller via USB and run

	psmovepair.exe

	to store the host's Bluetooth device address in the Move and register the
	controller. Follow the instructions on the screen until the Move's red
	status LED eventually remains lit to indicate a working Bluetooth
	connection.

	Note that the pairing step is necessary only once per controller. From that
	point on you can enable the Bluetooth connection simply by pressing the
	PS button. Only if you switched to a different Bluetooth adapter or deleted
	the controller from the list of Bluetooth devices you need to run
	psmovepair again for that controller.

6. Start one of the desired test applications

	If you previously chose to build the example applications (which is the
	default), you can then run

	example.exe

	for a basic example.
