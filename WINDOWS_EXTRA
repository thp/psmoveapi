There are a few quirks in Windows that make it somewhat difficult to use the psmoveapi.
While we continue to work to make it simpler, the following work-arounds may be necessary.

Pairing the controller to the host
==================================

Using the controllers' Bluetooth capabilities requires you to pair the
controller to the host computer first. That is what the psmovepair utility
is for. It is automatically built as part of the PS Move API.

Make sure that Bluetooth is enabled on your computer, then connect a Move
controller via USB and run

psmovepair.exe

to store the host's Bluetooth device address in the Move and register the
controller.

Try the remaining onscreen instructions but pairing is likely to fail at this point, then just Ctrl+C out of the program.

Reboot your computer. (Maybe not necessary, but it reportedly helps some.)

In Windows 8.1:

    Open "Devices and Printers."
    You should see a grayed out Motion Controller device.
    Double click on it to open its properties.
    Click on the "Services" tab. We are looking for a checkbox "Drivers for keyboard, mice, etc (HID)"
    If the box is unavailable, try pressing the PS button on your controller.
    If that still does not make the box available, try running [psmove-pair-win](https://github.com/nitsch/psmove-pair-win).
    When the box is available, check it.
    Click OK.
    Open regedit.
    Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\HidBth\Parameters\Devices
    You will likely only have one key there for your device. Change its VirtuallyCabled DWORD value to 1.
    Reboot.

You should now be able to pair immediately by pressing the PS button on the controller.
If that fails then try the [psmove-pair-win] utility again.

PS3EYE Camera
=============

The PS3EYE Camera works in Windows using either the CLEyeDriver (32-bit programs only, non-free)
or the PS3EYEDriver. The PS3EYEDriver should work with 32-bit or 64-bit programs, and it is free.

If you intend to use the PS3Eye camera then you currently need a registry entry for it.
Double click the provided ps3eye_settings.reg to enter the registry settings.

In Windows 8.1:
    The camera shows up as two interfaces to a single device.
    The two interfaces are not distinguishable except that only the camera can be opened.
    We have modified the PS3EYEDriver to work around this behaviour.
    
    If you are still getting crashes when trying to use the PS3EYEDriver in Windows,
    then please report the problem in github.
